<br><br><strong>Q: I missed the deadline to apply. What do I do now?</strong><br><br>
A: If the program as already begun, you will have to apply for the next program of SHINE. You should contact us through our website with your information so that we can add you to the email list and send reminders for deadlines in the future. If the program has not already started, apply anyway! These applications will have lower priority, but if you contact us in addition to applying we will be sure to consider you.
<br><br><strong>Q: I want to learn to dance, but I am not having a hard time in math class. Can I still apply?</strong><br><br> 
A: Yes, still apply. Through your application, we will be able to determine whether you are a good fit for SHINE.
<br><br><strong>Q: I want to apply to SHINE, but I don't live near the Boston/Cambridge area. Are there other branches?</strong><br><br> 
A: Unfortunately at this time we do not have other branches. However, we are aiming to have the program running in multiple locations for the summer session. Contact us through our online form with your information and we will see if we can get a branch of the program near you!
<br><br><strong>Q: Who will be teaching the dance and math?</strong><br><br> 
A: MIT students with years of dance experience will be the mentors for this program. To learn more about these amazing mentors visit our website http://www.shineforgirls.org! 	
<br><br><strong>Q: What styles of dance will I learn?</strong><br><br> 
A: SHINE focuses on a variety of styles, including hip-hop and jazz. The girls will learn and perform routines that require both stage presence and showmanship, as well as develop the discipline required to master technique. 
<br><br><strong>Q: Will participating in SHINE improve my grades and MCAS scores?</strong><br><br> 
A: While SHINE's purpose is larger than improving grades, students can expect to see better performance in school as a by-product of participating in the program. Similarly, our curriculum is designed to bolster the 6th and 7th grade math curriculum, so it will very likely improve MCAS scores.

<br><br><strong>Q: I have already participated in SHINE, and I want to do it again. Can I reapply</strong><br><br>?
A: SHINE is meant to be a one-time experience. Our curriculum has been created such that after a girl has been through the program she will be able to succeed and shine in her future endeavors. However, if you are still eligible for the program, you may still apply. Please include a description of what more you would like to get out of the program in your application. Let your friends who have not yet participated know about SHINE!
<br><br><strong>Q: Will there be food provided?</strong><br><br> 
A: Yes, at each session a healthy snack will be provided for the girls.
